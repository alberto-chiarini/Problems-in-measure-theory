This is a broad selection of exercises for the course \emph{Measure, integration and probability theory}. They are meant to accompany the lecture notes and give you the opportunity to exercise. If you wish to have your solution checked, send it in \LaTeX, and we will correct and polish it together, so that it can be featured in this notes in the ``Solutions'' part.

These collection of exercises are still in progress and they might contain small typos. If you see any or if you think that the statement of the problems is not yet crystal clear, feel free to drop a line. The most efficient way is to send an email to me, \href{mailto:a.chiarini@tue.nl}{a.chiarini@tue.nl}. All comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
